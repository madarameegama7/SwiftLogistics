## Developer B Implementation Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Clone and Setup**: The project is ready to run
2. **Database**: Already configured and populated with test data
3. **Dependencies**: All required dependencies are in `pom.xml`
4. **Base Structure**: Entity, Repository, and Service interfaces are complete

### Implementation Approach
1. **Start with Service Implementations**: Implement service interfaces using the provided repositories
2. **Create Controllers**: Build REST controllers that use the implemented services
3. **Test Incrementally**: Use the existing `TestController` endpoints to verify functionality
4. **Add Optimization Logic**: Implement the core route optimization algorithms

### Key Implementation Notes

#### Database Connection
```yaml
# Already configured in application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/swiftlogistics_rosdb
    username: rosdbuser
    password: rosdb123
```

#### Sample API Request Format
```json
{
  "vehiclePreferences": {
    "vehicleType": "VAN",
    "maxWeight": 1000.0,
    "maxVolume": 50.0
  },
  "optimizationSettings": {
    "optimizationType": "DISTANCE",
    "prioritizeHighPriority": true
  },
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "packageId": "PKG001",
      "recipientName": "John Doe",
      "weight": 10.5,
      "volume": 2.0,
      "priorityLevel": "HIGH",
      "deliveryAddress": {
        "streetAddress": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Colombo",
        "latitude": 6.9271,
        "longitude": 79.8612
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available Repository Methods
All repositories have comprehensive query methods. Examples:
- `vehicleRepository.findVehiclesWithSufficientCapacity(weight, volume)`
- `deliveryRepository.findPendingUnassignedDeliveries()`
- `routeRepository.findActiveRoutes()`
- `addressRepository.findAddressesWithinRadius(lat, lng, radius)`

### Testing Endpoints (Already Available)
- `GET /api/test/health` - Application health check
- `GET /api/test/db-connection` - Database connectivity test

### Database Schema Reference
- **addresses**: id, street_address, city, state, postal_code, country, latitude, longitude
- **vehicles**: id, vehicle_number, vehicle_type, max_weight, max_volume, fuel_efficiency, driver_name, driver_contact, status, current_latitude, current_longitude
- **routes**: id, route_name, vehicle_id, start_time, end_time, total_distance, estimated_duration, optimization_type, status, priority_level
- **deliveries**: id, package_id, route_id, delivery_address_id, recipient_name, recipient_contact, weight, volume, package_type, priority_level, status, expected_delivery_time, actual_delivery_time, special_instructions
